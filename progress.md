## Closure Lodestar Recovery - 2026-06-18T19:29:21+08:00

- Goal: 按照最新 PRD 持续推进 DreamJourney_dev 到可真实测试、可真机验收、可持续迭代状态
- Mode: Execute
- Phase: Implementation
- Task: continue non-device PRD function development; latest slice is deployed Postgres backend acceptance
- Blockers: true-device signing/operation still required for final acceptance; newest Stitch Echo variants still need explicit selection before replacing the current public Echo surface

### Resume Protocol
1. If a ledger has a non-`none` next action, run `ledger.py next` and perform exactly that action.
2. After each recursive state change, run `sync_recursive_to_lodestar.py`.
3. If all mapped ledgers report `next_action=none`, run Lodestar Review before final delivery.

## Implementation Checkpoint - 2026-06-18T19:36:34+0800

- Task: close the public profile metadata backend contract.
- Completed: backend `POST /profile` and `GET /profile/{user_id}` now persist nickname, gender, region, and avatar metadata; iOS profile save now syncs via `/profile` while preserving local-first save warnings.
- Evidence: backend `verify_backend.sh` passed with 63 tests; release regression `20260618-profile-backend-contract-r3` passed static guards, iOS Debug simulator build, Archive -> Echo smoke, and Echo delayed reply notification smoke.
- Next: deploy `/profile` to the selected backend environment and run release-like backend acceptance; `/auth/password` remains hidden until security design and backend implementation are ready.
