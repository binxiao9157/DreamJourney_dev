# Task Plan

## STATUS

- **Goal:** 按照最新 PRD 持续推进 DreamJourney_dev 到可真实测试、可真机验收、可持续迭代状态
- **Mode:** Review
- **Phase:** Phase 3 non-device session lease and concurrency control complete
- **Task:** docs/plans/task_08_p0-digital-human-session-lease.md
- **Blockers:** no implementation blocker; provider-side quota release timing remains a later true-device acceptance item

## Key Decisions

- Closure Lodestar is active: Lodestar files are the project-level source of truth.
- Recursive Closure ledgers are task-level closure engines under `.complex-problems/`.
- Task 1 closed: PRD continuation gap map is recorded in `docs/superpowers/status/2026-06-18-prd-continuation-gap-map.md`.
- Task 2 closed: persona-scoped archive storage/backend/context contract is implemented and guarded.
- Task 3 closed: real-device/backend acceptance readiness is documented and guarded; true backend/device execution still waits for user-provided environment.
- Task 4 closed: hidden family/persona switcher, profile safety shells, and care visibility gates are implemented and guarded.
- Task 5 closed: release QA handoff is documented and simulator/static QA passed.
- Post-review continuation: `长辈关怀` aggregate child dashboard, hidden `阳光 / 星辰 / 静默` mode management, Echo/Profile lifecycle effects, hidden profile care escalation draft, care escalation draft-only backend boundary smoke, archive media release readiness contract, archive media entries smoke harness, family/persona release readiness smoke, App-side backend family acceptance hardening, PRD coverage matrix, phase 0 backend alignment with the existing `DreamJourneyBackend`, release-like backend acceptance harness, one-command release regression, and final Stitch visual refresh are complete without true-device execution.
- Current target after this slice: release-like FastAPI/Postgres backend acceptance passed with run `20260618-deployed-postgres-acceptance-after-deploy`; `我的` remains the third public tab and carries settings/account/legal/care entries; release handoff mode now forces the release-like backend gate unless explicitly overridden; public MVP archive header polish is complete; hidden candidate release matrix is guarded and documented; Echo waiting reply default policy now enters waiting state after the third final user voice turn.
- Profile IA contract exists: `我的` remains the third public tab and carries settings/account/legal/care entries; `长辈关怀` is Profile/Care content, not a tab rename.
- Task 6 is complete: deterministic hash-based trial-slot selection was replaced with persistent exclusive assignment, legacy `S_` profiles remain readable, and app-facing `voiceProfileId` is separated from provider-facing speaker IDs.
- Account purge retires owned provider slots; deleted voice data is never silently recycled to another user.
- Task 7 is complete: Echo now has lifecycle/session and interaction generations, a cancellable background release lease, generation-bound runtime/audio ownership, deterministic tap interruption, guarded microphone recovery, stale PCM isolation, and immediate quota fallback. Ledger `L20260710-133057` is closed.
- Task 8 is complete and deployed: digital-human session leases now support safe persistence, reuse, heartbeat, release, TTL expiry, atomic capacity arbitration, iOS lifecycle cleanup, stale-response release, and non-device/deployed Postgres gates. Backend `e9b3104` is live and ledger `L20260710-145321` is closed.

## Scope

Phase 2 and Phase 3 are closed, and the backend deployment plus deployed Postgres smoke passed. The next delivery boundary is the deferred true-device Tencent digital-human and cloned-voice acceptance pass.

## Recovery

On resume, read this file, `findings.md`, `progress.md`, `docs/plans/impl_plan_index.md`, and `.closure-lodestar/task-ledgers.json`; then run:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/closure-lodestar/scripts/recover.py --workspace .
```
